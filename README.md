-It is in the same level as C# and Java (high-level programming language)

Is it a strongly or loosely typed language?
-Kotlin is a strongly typed language.  This means that once you declare a variable with a specific
type, you cannot change it to a different type without explicit type casting that enforce by a compiler.

-Kotlin is a compiled language. Kotlin source code is compiled into bytecode, 
which is executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
